## Living Real Project Overview

The initial view is a landing page with a carosel of photos of the owner's properties. There are options on this landing page for owners and tenants to login.  Potential applicants can view the properties and their associated details.  

Details of the properties can be viewed (without logging in) by clicking on a photo in the carousel.

Once logged in, owners are directed to a dashboard page where they can maintain (add, update, and remove) properties, maintain (add, update, and remove) tenants, and review submitted maintenance requests.

When tenants login, they are directed to a dashboard page where they can see details about their property, review their lease agreement, and submit maintenance requests.

Applicants, who won't have a login, can view the details of each property in the photo carousel. Clicking on a photo will display additional images of that specific property, as well as its associated details and amenities. Potential tenants can submit an application with the application fee on desired properties.
