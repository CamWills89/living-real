## Applicant Acceptance Criteria

From the initial view, the landing page, a potential tenant (applicant) can use the carousel to view the primary image of the available properties.  

As an individual interested in renting a house:

* When I access the website, then I see a carousel of available home photos.

* When I click on a home photo of interest, then the site displays additional details about the home, as well as a carousel of additional photos of the inside/outside of the home.

* When I browse the page for a specific home, the details include a list of amenities, including the associated school district and the distance to shopping malls and other attractions.

* When I decide on a particular home, I can fill out and submit an application, and the associated application fee.
